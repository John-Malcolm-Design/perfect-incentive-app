## About

### Rebrand

The app is part of an ongoing rebrand project which I am driving and includes:
- Web Sites
- Web Apps
- Mobile Apps
- Credit Cards
- Product Packaging 
- Gift Cards
- Social Media & Email Marketing

All fonts, iconography, imagery and sizing within the app are consistent with the style guides in development.

### Technologies
Cross platform app written in Javascript.

- **Visual Studio 2015**: Provides debugging and templating out of the box for Ionic and although I used it for this project any IDE that supports Javascript can be used, and Ionic commands can be run via the terminal.
- **Ionic**: Style normalisation with Bootsrap & Ionic scss. SPA MVC code structure with AngularJS.
- **Cordova**: Compiles app and provides hooks into underlying device OS. App sits in Webview present on all mobile devices.
- **NPM**: Back end package manager.
- **Bower**: Client Side package manager.
- **Gulp**: Build tool. Used for compiling sass and performing live reload.
- **Git**: Version Control.
- **ASP.NET MVC 5**: Server side code - not written by me although I had to do some work on the server side in order to get the endpoints for my app working correctly (mostly CORS and SSL issues).
